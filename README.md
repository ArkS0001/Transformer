# Transformer
The Transformer is a neural network architecture that utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, revolutionizing tasks like language modeling and translation by capturing long-range dependencies effectively.

A Transformer is a model architecture that eschews recurrence and instead relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. Before Transformers, the dominant sequence transduction models were based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The Transformer also employs an encoder and decoder, but removing recurrence in favor of attention mechanisms allows for significantly more parallelization than methods like RNNs and CNNs.
